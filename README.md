UNET architecture was first introduced in the paper ["U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) by Olaf Ronneberger. It has since widely been used in the field of computer vision's image segmentation. Many have altered the UNET as per their needs while the implementation of the original UNET architecture is pretty straightforward and simple.
